           <h4>Message From Chairman:</h4>
           <div id="message">
           <p>Welcome to the Department of Physics at The Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka Bangladesh. It has been my extraordinary privilege to serve as Chair of the Department of Physics. It is indeed an honour to do so, as this Departmentpossesses an extraordinarily collegial and collaborative atmosphere. Despite located in a growing economic country, one of the oldest and prestigious public-funded university is in excellent shape. This is very much due to the dedication and enthusiasm of the faculty, staff, and student body. <br><br>

        We are a growing world-class department with strong programs in research and academics, nationally and internationally recognized faculty members, ties to physics-related industries and research centres, and a record of student success. With national and international collaboration, we strive to provide students with access to the state-of-the-art research efforts of a larger institution, while still maintaining the level of personal interaction with faculty found at smaller places. <br><br>
            
        Located in Savar, the naturally enriched one of the greenest campus of Bangladesh and in winter, the home of migratory birds, the Department of Physics offers a wide variety of opportunities. Our primary strengths lie in the areas of Plasma physics, Solid State Physics, Condensed matter/materials science and Computational Physics. In addition to these key areas, there is an active research group in biological physics and a growing effort in medical physics. All these groups carry out world-class research with close ties to the larger professional community and promote interactions between students and faculty that aim to prepare students to succeed in that community. <br><br>
            
        The Department's research equipment includes a precision impedance analyser, UV-vis Spectrometer, spin coater, Ball Milling Machine, Ultrasonic cleaner, Hydraulic press, High-temperature oven etc. along with high-performance computing facilities. The Department also has the research collaboration with the well equipped Wazed Miah Science Research Center (WMRC), JU, Bangladesh. <br><br>
            
        In summary, our department is vibrant and active, and an excellent place to pursue your interests in Physics. As you browse our web pages, we hope you find the information you seek. For further information, please do not hesitate to contact me directly or feel free to contact any of our faculty or staff by email or phone. Thank you for visiting us, and we hope to have the opportunity to meet you in person!</p>
